Maintaining legacy code is not that whereof one is dreaming.

In this case old Object Pascal code.

Introducing a code generator to simplify the work is only the half way.

Because Object Pascal is missing an 'equals' method.

So I have built 'equals' methods for most data types.

Maybe it can help somebody beside myself yet...
